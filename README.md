Lab 3: comm.py: failed on empty files. simple checks should be made to function str_process(self, file)

Lab 5: sfrob.c: Found bugs. Also the logic is simply horrible. You can check 'Lab 7/sfrobu.c' for a better one.
       
       lab5.txt: -2/15, insufficient answers to question 2 and 4.

Lab 7: linear regression model is not enough. just copy the behavior of quick sort.
