2. Checkout
cd diffutils
git checkout -b 'quote' 'v3.0'

3. Install patches
patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt 
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

The patching is successful.

4 & 5. Compose ChangeLog
I first just typed emacs, and used (C-x 4 a) to open the ChangeLog.

Then I just copied appropriate entries the changelog from git-log.txt.

Note: I could have used:
emacs src/cmp.c
emacs src/diff.c
...
etc

and compose changelog with (C-x 4 a) for each one.

But I realized that I don't need to.
The spec says "by adapting the change log from the original patch" anyway.

6. Commit Changes
git commit -aF ChangeLog
I used the changelog I composed in file ChangeLog to commit.

7. Generating patches
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

I used the above command to generate the formatted-patch.txt

8. Verification of Partner's Patch

Partner's name: Yu Wang
Partner's UID:	704409906

I renamed her patch to "wy-formatted-patch.txt"

First I created a new 3.0 branch called "partner".
git checkout -b 'partner' 'v3.0'

Then I used:
git am wy-formatted-patch.txt
Applying: 2016-01-29 Yu Wang <wangyu@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

And the result is successful.

Then I repeated the part from step 13 of the lab part.
./boostrap
patch -p0 < gets.diff
./configure
make

Then I ran:
./src/diff . -
and
./src/diff --help

No ` found. So it works.

Also,
Rujun Yao (I don't know his email nor UID) asked me for the patch,
but he didn't give me his patch. So I can't verify his patch.

9. Verification of ChangeLog
make distdir

I used this command to verify that ChangeLog works.

After running for a while, it creates a new folder: diffutils-3.0.1-d400
Then I went into that folder and checked the ChangeLog:

The first entry is the entry I created:

2016-01-29  Zhongyang Liu  <zhongyan@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

        2016-01-29  Zhongyang Liu  <zhongyan@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>
                maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
		...

So it works.

10. gitk
Since ~/eggert/src/gnu/emacs doesn't exist,
I cloned the one from savannah's main repo.

git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git gitrepo

into a new folder called "gitrepo"

cd gitrepo
gitk

Then I used gitk to check

The newest merge point that is no newer than 2015-01-25 is:

Merge branch 'master' into xwidget 2015-01-25 12:19:27
