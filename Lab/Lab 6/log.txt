1. Set up Ubuntu
I used the lab computer and entered the BIOS to change the boot sequence.

Then I used try Ubuntu to run it from the DVD.

2. Install OpenSSH
I did:

sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

To install OpenSSH stuff.

3. Setup Server
a. generate keys
ssh-keygen
And I used the defualt location

The password (public key) is: cs35llab6

Emacs is not installed so I installed it using:
sudo apt-get install emacs

b. find out ip address
ifconfig

10.97.85.72

Kyle:
10.97.85.69

Daniel:
10.97.85.26

Disable password-based authentication:
sudo emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config

4. Setup Clients Account

For Kyle:
sudo useradd -d /home/kyle -m kyle
sudo passwd kyle
sudo mkdir /home/kyle/.ssh
cd /home/kyle
sudo chown -R kyle .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

For Daniel:
sudo useradd -d /home/daniel -m daniel
sudo passwd daniel
sudo mkdir /home/daniel/.ssh
cd /home/daniel
sudo chown -R daniel .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

For me:
I typed the following on Kyle's and Daniel's computer
sudo useradd -d /home/jerry -m jerry
sudo passwd jerry

5. Test SSH for Password Authentication
Kyle's host
ssh -X jerry@10.97.85.69
Then I typed
xterm

It popped up an xterm window.

It also works on Daniel's host.
Steps are the same except with a different IP address.

6. Setup key-based authentication
For Kyle:
ssh-copy-id -i jerry@10.97.85.69
I first typped yes.
Then I typped in my password to log in and exited.

ssh-add
I typped in the public key: cs35llab6

Then I did
ssh jerry@10.97.85.69
Then every time after this I can log in without typing anything.

Then I did
ssh -X jerry@10.97.85.69
xterm
An xterm shell window popped up.

And kyle checked using:
ps aux
He saw a daemon called xterm and the user is jerry

So it works.

For Daniel's host, steps are the same except with a different IP address.
It also works.
