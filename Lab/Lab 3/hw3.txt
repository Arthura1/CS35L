Q1:
Since 'case_long_iso_time_style:' is a label for the goto command,
only one of which to this label is in 'ls.c', and that line is deleted
in the patch, we can safely remove it.

It was not necessary to remove that line since it affects nothing.
The compiler will ignore it since nothing uses this label.

Q2:
If no translation was found by the function 'dcgettext',
it will return the same value as long_time_format[i].

So for locales that do not have a translation, 
it will display something that the particular language speaker
cannot understand.

The --time-style=long-iso option still works, 
but not everyone knows this command. 
So it is not a good idea generally to patch it the way Brady did.

Q3:
When we want to output random lines on the file /dev/null,
it outputs IndexError when calling chooseline().

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]
    # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

It is because in the code, the condition is numlines < 0, so
if we don't specify that the number of lines is zero,
they function will choose a line from a file with no lines.
That's undefined behavior.

Q4:
Run randline.py under python3 gives us:
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

By python 3 documentation, in python3 IOError is merged into OSError,
and the corresponding argument changed.

The correct way should be:

except OSError as err:
       parser.error("OS error: {0}".format(err))
